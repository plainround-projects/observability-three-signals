# mypy

## What it is

mypy is a **static type checker** for Python. It reads your code and your type hints, without running the program, and reports places where the types do not fit: calling a function with a string where an int is required, returning `None` where a `str` is promised, calling a method that does not exist. It catches this class of mistake before the program ever starts.

## Why this repository uses it

Type hints are documentation that a tool checks. In a layered design they also protect the boundaries: a `Protocol` in the application layer is only meaningful if someone verifies that the adapters really match it. mypy does that for every adapter and every fake, in strict mode.

## Where it appears

| Path | What it does with mypy |
| --- | --- |
| `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.mypy]` and overrides) | The settings. |
| `Makefile` (`lint`) | Runs `mypy` with no arguments, which uses `files` from the configuration. |
| Every `src/**/*.py` | Fully annotated. |

## How it works underneath

mypy parses every file it is told to check (`files = ["src", "tests"]` in the configuration), builds a model of every function and class from the type hints, then infers the type of each expression and compares it with what is expected. For third-party libraries it needs **type information**. Many libraries ship it inside the package (a marker file named `py.typed`). Others have a separate "stubs" package (`types-requests`). A library with neither is reported as "missing imports" unless you list it under `ignore_missing_imports`.

`strict = true` turns on a bundle of strict options: every function must be annotated, no implicit `Any`, no untyped calls from typed code, unused ignores are errors, and so on. `# type: ignore[code]` on one line tells mypy to skip that line's named error; a test uses it when it passes a wrong type on purpose.

Python never checks hints at run time. A wrong hint changes nothing about how the program runs.

## Walkthrough of this repository's use

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.12"
strict = true
files = ["src", "tests"]
```

`python_version = "3.12"` makes mypy check against Python 3.12's library definitions. `strict = true` turns on all strict options. `files = ["src", "tests"]` is what gets checked when you run `mypy` with no arguments.

```toml
[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = ["opentelemetry.*", "waitress", "waitress.*"]
ignore_missing_imports = true
```

`[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` (double brackets: one item of a list) applies settings to some modules only. `module = ["opentelemetry.*", "waitress", "waitress.*"]` names modules mypy has no complete type information for, and `ignore_missing_imports = true` stops it from reporting them. `opentelemetry.*` is a wildcard for every sub-module; the `opentelemetry` namespace is split across several installed packages, so mypy cannot always resolve it.

```toml
# Test functions are named for the behavior they check; annotating every one adds noise, not safety.
[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = ["tests.*"]
disallow_untyped_defs = false
disallow_incomplete_defs = false
disallow_untyped_calls = false
```

The comment explains the second override: test functions are named for the behavior they check; annotating every one adds noise. For `tests.*`, `disallow_untyped_defs`, `disallow_incomplete_defs` and `disallow_untyped_calls` are set to `false`, so unannotated test functions are allowed, while the rest of strict mode still applies.

Examples in the code of what strict mode demands: every function in `src` has parameter and return types (`-> None` included); `dict[str, Any]` instead of a bare `dict`; `Mapping[str, str]` for read-only mappings; `Callable[[], float]` for the clock; and `bool(response.status == 200)` in `lab/health_cli.py` because the library's `status` is typed loosely and strict mode refuses to return `Any` from a function declared to return `bool`.

## Try it yourself

```bash
.venv/bin/mypy
```

Expected: `Success: no issues found in N source files`.

```bash
printf 'def f(x: int) -> str:\n    return x\n' > /tmp/demo_mypy.py && .venv/bin/mypy /tmp/demo_mypy.py; rm /tmp/demo_mypy.py
```

Expected: `error: Incompatible return value type (got "int", expected "str")`.

```bash
.venv/bin/mypy --strict --no-incremental src/three_signals/domain/orders.py
```

Expected: `Success: no issues found in 1 source file`.

```bash
.venv/bin/mypy --config-file= --show-error-codes -c "x: int = 'a'"
```

Expected: an error line ending in `[assignment]`, the code you would put in `# type: ignore[assignment]`. (`--config-file=` with nothing after it ignores `pyproject.toml`, whose `files` setting would otherwise conflict with `-c`.)

```bash
grep -rn "type: ignore" src tests | head
```

Expected: only the few deliberate ignores in `tests/unit/domain/test_orders.py`, each with a named code.

## Mistakes people make

- **Using `Any` to make errors go away.** It switches checking off for that value and everything derived from it.
- **Blanket `# type: ignore`.** Always name the error code so only that error is hidden.
- **Thinking passing mypy proves correctness.** It proves the types are consistent, not that the logic is right.
- **Not pinning the stub packages**, so a new stub release suddenly fails the build.

## Check yourself

1. Does mypy run your program? *No. It reads the code and the hints only.*
2. What does `strict = true` do? *It enables the strict checks, such as requiring annotations on every function.*
3. Why is `types-requests` installed? *It supplies type information for `requests`, which does not ship its own in this version of the setup.*
4. What does `ignore_missing_imports` do for a module? *It stops mypy from reporting an error when it has no type information for it.*
5. What happens at run time to a type hint? *Nothing; Python ignores it.*
